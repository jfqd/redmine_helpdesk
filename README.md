# Redmine Helpdesk

* Support for sending an email notification to the (anonymous user) supportclient on ticket creation
* A standard first reply message can be send to the supportclient on ticket creation (optional, per project)
* The email-footer for the email notification to the supportclient can be adjusted (optional, per project)

  - Issue parameters
    - ##issue-id##
    - ##issue-subject##
    - ##issue-tracker##
    - ##issue-status##

    - ##user-login##
    - all user custom fields: ##user-cf-[user's custom field name]##, e.g. ##user-cf-position##
  - Base parameters
    - ##time-now##
* The sender email-address can be adjusted (optional, per project)

## Cronjob

Creating tickets from support emails through an IMAP-account is done by a cronjob. If you are not familiar with cron you first should read about the concept. The following syntax is for ubuntu or debian linux:

```
*/5 * * * * redmineuser /path/to/your/rake -f /path/to/redmine/Rakefile --silent redmine:email:receive_imap RAILS_ENV="production" host=mail.example.com port=993 username=username password=password ssl=true project=project_identifier folder=INBOX move_on_success=processed move_on_failure=failed no_permission_check=1 unknown_user=accept 1 > /dev/null
```

Please note that forwarding emails with **rdm-mailhandler.rb** is currently **not supported** by the plugin.

## Development

### Testing

Rake tasks for testing against Redmine are provided. Redmine is installed under `test/app` and tests are run against the local instance.

```bash
REDMINE_VERSION=3.2 DATABASE_ADAPTER=mysql rake helpdesk:redmine:install
```

Docker is used to provide local MySQL (`DATABASE_ADAPTER=mysql`) and PostgreSQL (`DATABASE_ADAPTER=postgresql_ext`) instances.

```bash
export DATABASE_ADAPTER=mysql
rake helpdesk:prepare_local
rake helpdesk:migrate
```

Test suite can be executed with:

```bash
DATABASE_ADAPTER=mysql rake helpdesk:ext_ci
```

The local database instance has to be stopped with a rake task:

```bash
rake helpdesk:localdb:stop
```
