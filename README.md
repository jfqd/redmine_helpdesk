[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jfqd/redmine_helpdesk.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jfqd/redmine_helpdesk) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/jfqd/redmine_helpdesk/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/jfqd/redmine_helpdesk) [![Test Coverage](https://codeclimate.com/github/jfqd/redmine_helpdesk/badges/coverage.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/jfqd/redmine_helpdesk)

Lightweight helpdesk plugin for redmine. Adds the email sender-address of an anonymous supportclient to the custom field 'owner-email' of a ticket which was created by a support email. Answers can be send to the supportclient by checking the support checkbox on a journal.

## Features

* No need to create any user accounts for anonymous user
* Support for sending an email notification to the (anonymous user) supportclient on ticket creation
* A standard first reply message can be send to the supportclient on ticket creation (optional, per project)
* The email-footer for the email notification to the supportclient can be adjusted (optional, per project)
* The email-footer can be customized by using the following placeholders: ##user-name##, ##user-firstname##, ##user-lastname##, ##user-mail##, ##user-login## for all user custom fields
* The sender email-address can be adjusted (optional, per project)
* Internal communication is not send to the supportclient
* The supportclient will get an email notification if the support checkbox on the journal is checked
* Journal attachments will be delivered too

## Usage

To use the helpdesk functionality you need to

* add the custom field 'owner-email' to a project in the project configuration
* add a standard first reply message into the custom_field 'helpdesk-first-reply' in the project configuration (optional)
* add an email-footer into the custom_field 'helpdesk-email-footer' in the project configuration
* add a sender email address into the custom_field 'helpdesk-sender-email' in the project configuration (optional)
* make sure 'Issue added' and 'Issue updated' in the general redmine settings for email notifications are checked
* add the permission 'Treat as supportclient' to all roles you want to be treated as supportclient (the permission is automatically added to the 'Anonymous' role)
* disable standard notifications for non-anonymous supportclients to prevent their spamming (optional)
* add a cronjob for creating issues from support emails

**Only public projects could be used for the helpdesk functionality**. If you want to use it with private projects [issue #75](https://github.com/jfqd/redmine_helpdesk/issues/75#issuecomment-101950450) might be helpful to you.

## Cronjob

Creating tickets from support emails through an IMAP-account is done by a cronjob. If you are not familiar with cron you first should read about the concept. The following syntax is for ubuntu or debian linux:

```
*/5 * * * * redmineuser /path/to/your/rake -f /path/to/redmine/Rakefile --silent redmine:email:receive_imap RAILS_ENV="production" host=mail.example.com port=993 username=username password=password ssl=true project=project_identifier folder=INBOX move_on_success=processed move_on_failure=failed no_permission_check=1 unknown_user=accept 1 > /dev/null
```

Please note that forwarding emails with **rdm-mailhandler.rb** is currently **not supported** by the plugin.

## Development

### Testing

Rake tasks for testing against Redmine are provided. Redmine is installed under `test/app` and tests are run against the local instance.

```bash
REDMINE_VERSION=3.2 DATABASE_ADAPTER=mysql rake helpdesk:redmine:install
```

Docker is used to provide local MySQL (`DATABASE_ADAPTER=mysql`) and PostgreSQL (`DATABASE_ADAPTER=postgresql_ext`) instances.

```bash
export DATABASE_ADAPTER=mysql
rake helpdesk:prepare_local
rake helpdesk:migrate
```

Test suite can be executed with:

```bash
DATABASE_ADAPTER=mysql rake helpdesk:ext_ci
```

The local database instance has to be stopped with a rake task:

```bash
rake helpdesk:localdb:stop
```
